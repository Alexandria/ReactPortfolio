      My name is Lex and I have have a passion for building web applications.
      Although I prefer the backend of the stack I have experience in both
      frontend and backend development. I work primarily with NodeJs and have
      been using Express to build my APIs. When I am not coding, I enjoy playing
      boardgames and reading and mentoring. Feel free to contact me if you have
      any questions about my work.
